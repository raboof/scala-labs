This repository is an experiment for a new way of managing code for a workshop/course.

Maintaining the 'given' and 'solutions' code for a workshop/course is a challenge, especially
if there are a number of exercise where each exercise builds on the previous.

The main initial goals are to:

* Make it easy for participants to check out the 'starting point' for each exercise
* Make it easy to share the solution to the exercise
* Make it easy to maintain the course code, for example introducing new best practices or upgrading versions

Additionally, this approach introduces some opportunities for other nice features:

* Make it easy for participants to compare their solutions, between each other and to the given solution
* Check the health of each 'step' in the course using some kind of build tool

Even further into the future:

* Based on a 'master' repo like this, for a given specific iteration of the workshop/course we could
generate a repo specifically for this course
* We could host this repo ourself (spinning up an image on AWS or similar), and have fine-grained
control over e.g. when we allow access to the solutions, and some nice UI features.


The general approach is to have one branch (this one) containing metadata about the workshop/course,
and a branch for each starting point and/or example solution in the course.

Each branch should be a valid project that can be checked by CI, and from the metadata branch we could
check things like the fact that each 'starting point' is a parent of each 'example solution' in the course.

When doing maintenance on the course, you could start by making the change on the 'earliest' branch where
the change is desired, and then merge it into all later steps.
